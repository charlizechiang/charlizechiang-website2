        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business (Marketing)ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a pre-business student at the University of California Riverside and would like to pursue Business Marketing in the future. I thrive in environments where innovation and experimentation are encouraged and enjoy exploring new concepts. I am known for bringing new inspiration and thought-provoking ideas. For example, when I was working for my school's newspaper team, I illustrated and constantly revised my own original art pieces to meet the quality and frequent news articles. As the photo editor, I communicated with the photographers and news editors to see which pictures should be taken that best correspond to and represent the schoolâ€™s news topics while assigning projects and ensuring all illustrators were producing artwork for our news articles to publish.
<br><br>

        My diverse background has been a great advantage for me in cultivating social media, marketing and advertising, and research strengths. I am fluent in speaking, reading, and writing in Mandarin from studying for 5 years in Taiwan. I have volunteered as a Chinese tutor for children before and am familiar with communicating with their parents to adjust to different teaching styles for different individuals. My leadership experience includes being the Club President of RAISE Humane Foundation and BOHS Chinese Club. During that time, I helped the club raise money by selling Native Taiwanese bracelets and Chinese food which were made by club members at our events, reached out to local restaurants such as Blaze Pizza and Chipotle for Covid friendly fundraising events, and managed clubâ€™s Instagram account where we would post different Chinese cultural topic self made posts every Monday to educate our members while playing Kahoot on the information during our monthly meetings. 
<br><br>

        I am motivated, reliable, and creative with a strong work ethic and an artistic eye. People often say that I am great at bringing a fun, loving, and enthusiastic attitude. My work experience includes being a Tennis Assistant Coach at my High Schoolâ€™s tennis team and currently a student worker at UCR Dining Services. As the assistant coach I researched, analyzed, organized, and implemented tennis drills to effectively train high school students while providing feedback and advice on techniques and forms. As a student worker I learned how to effectively manage my time to keep up with my grades and daily work schedules. I also have volunteered at numerous dog and cat shelters in the past including Priceless Pets as well as Vida, and animal rescue services. Please contact me if you would like to schedule an interview or have any questions about my skills or experience.
